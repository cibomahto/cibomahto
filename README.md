## Hey!

I'm Matthew Mets,  an electronics engineer, focusing on entertainment and consumer product development. Through my design studio Blinkinlabs, I help clients bring their ideas from concept to production. I specialize in design for manufacture and certification. We have an in-house micro electronics assembly line, and a network of contract manufacturers in China that we can recommend for larger volume productions.
